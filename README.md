## Notice Regarding API Token
This API wrapper does not facilitate obtaining 
an access token, which is required to submit requests to the NFL API. The 
author of this API wrapper is not aware of any documented method to obtain 
an access token, and will not assist with this. If you do not have a valid 
method of obtaining an access token, this API wrapper will be useless.

does not contain any NFL data, and the use of NFL data is subject to NFL copyright
